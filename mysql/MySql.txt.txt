SQL (Structured Query Language)
Definition: SQL is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
It includes commands to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data, as well as create and modify database structures.
Purpose: SQL provides a universal syntax for interacting with databases, making it the foundation of 
relational database management systems (RDBMS).

MySQL
Definition: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its query language.
Developed by: MySQL AB (later acquired by Oracle Corporation).
Usage: Commonly used for web applications, such as WordPress, e-commerce platforms, and more.

Key Features:
Multi-threaded and multi-user.
Supports various storage engines like InnoDB, MyISAM, etc.
Used with programming languages like PHP, Python, and Java.
Limitations: Some proprietary features introduced after Oracle's acquisition led to forks like MariaDB.


MariaDB
Definition: MariaDB is a fork of MySQL created by the original developers of MySQL, intended to remain open-source and community-driven.
Reason for Fork: Concerns over Oracle's acquisition of MySQL led to the creation of MariaDB.


Key Features:
Fully compatible with MySQL: Can replace MySQL seamlessly in most applications.
Improved performance: Focuses on speed, reliability, and scalability.
Open-source: Entirely community-driven, ensuring future-proofing.
Enhanced features: Includes improvements like new storage engines, better replication, and security enhancements

Adoption: Many organizations and Linux distributions now prefer MariaDB as the default RDBMS over MySQL.
